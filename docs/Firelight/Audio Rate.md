Certainly! Adjusting the audio rate based on the difference between the expected and actual number of frames produced allows you to dynamically adapt to varying processing speeds and maintain a consistent playback rate. Here's an example of how you can implement this:


```
const int expectedFramesPerTick = X;
const int bufferSize = ...; // Number of frames in the audio buffer
const double playbackRateAdjustmentFactor = 0.95; // Adjust this factor as needed

// Audio buffer and buffer index
int buffer[bufferSize];
int bufferIndex = 0;

// Initial playback rate
double playbackRate = 1.0;

// Audio callback function
void audioCallback(void* userdata, Uint8* stream, int len) {
    // Calculate frames to produce based on the adjusted playback rate
    int framesToProduce = (int)(expectedFramesPerTick * playbackRate);

    // Calculate frames to skip if needed
    if (bufferIndex + framesToProduce > bufferSize) {
        int framesToSkip = (bufferIndex + framesToProduce) - bufferSize;
        bufferIndex += framesToSkip;
        framesToProduce -= framesToSkip;
    }

    // Copy frames to the audio stream
    SDL_MixAudio(stream, &buffer[bufferIndex], framesToProduce * sizeof(int), SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME);

    // Update buffer index
    bufferIndex += framesToProduce;

    // Adjust audio rate based on the difference between expected and actual frames
    double rateAdjustment = (double)expectedFramesPerTick / framesToProduce;
    playbackRate *= playbackRateAdjustmentFactor * rateAdjustment;

    // Ensure the playback rate doesn't exceed certain bounds (if needed)
    if (playbackRate < 0.5) {
        playbackRate = 0.5;
    } else if (playbackRate > 2.0) {
        playbackRate = 2.0;
    }
}

```

In this example, we introduce the `playbackRate` variable, which starts at 1.0, representing the initial playback rate. The `playbackRateAdjustmentFactor` determines how aggressively the playback rate adjusts based on the frame difference. You can adjust this factor to control the rate of change.

Here's how the process works:

1. Calculate the number of frames to produce based on the adjusted playback rate.
2. If there are not enough frames in the buffer to produce the calculated number of frames, skip frames as needed to catch up.
3. Adjust the playback rate based on the ratio between the expected and actual frames produced. The `rateAdjustment` factor calculates how much to adjust the playback rate to match the expected frame rate.
4. Ensure that the playback rate remains within desired bounds (optional).

By dynamically adjusting the playback rate, your audio playback should adapt to varying processing speeds while maintaining a consistent overall playback rate. You can fine-tune the adjustment factor and rate bounds to suit your application's specific requirements.
